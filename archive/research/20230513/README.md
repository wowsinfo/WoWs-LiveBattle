Fire or Flooding

- 0XAFC50, torpedo damage
- 6D 00 00 00 2F 00 00 00, this can be using torpedo 6 in this case
- 6B 00 00 00 21 00 00 00, this can be main battery

61 35 0C, enemy ship ID

These two are extremely suspicious on fire or flooding
15 00 00 00 08 00 00 00
43 00 00 00 09 00 00 00
This one can be something different, not so sure

battle logic is 5F 35 0C, my ship ID is 60 35 0C

battle and my ship
???????? 5f350c 00 * 60350c00
